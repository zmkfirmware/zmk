## A pykwalify schema for basic validation of the structure of a
## manifest YAML file.  (Full validation would require additional work,
## e.g. to validate that remote URLs obey the URL format specified in
## rfc1738.)
##
## This schema has similar semantics to the repo XML format:
##
## https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/+/master/docs/manifest-format.md
##
## However, the features don't map 1:1.
