|Build Status|

Python interface for the SEGGER J-Link.

Requirements
------------

-  `Python >= 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
-  `GNU ARM Embedded
   Toolchain <https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded>`__ (for functional
   tests)
-  `SEGGER J-Link Tools >=
   6.0b <https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink>`__

Installation
------------

Clone the project into a local repository, then navigate to the
directory and run:

::

   $ python setup.py install

External Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use this library, you will need to have installed the SEGGER
tools. The tools can be installed from the SEGGER website
`here <https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink>`__. This package is
compatible with versions of the SEGGER tool ``>= 6.0b``. Download the
software under ``J-Link Software and Documentation Pack`` for your
specific hardware. ``PyLink`` will automatically find the library if you
have installed it this way, but for best results, you should use one of
the two methods listed below depending on your operating system:

On Mac
^^^^^^

::

   # Option A: Copy the library to your libraries directory.
   $ cp libjlinkarm.dylib /usr/local/lib/

   # Option B: Add SEGGER's J-Link directory to your dynamic libraries path.
   $ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/SEGGER/JLink:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

Windows searches for DLLs in the following order:

1. The current directory of execution.
2. The Windows system directory.
3. The Windows directory.

You can copy the ``JLinkARM.dll`` to any of the directories listed
above. Alternatively, add the SEGGER J-Link directory to your
``%PATH%``.

On Linux
^^^^^^^^

::

   # Option A: Copy the library to your libraries directory.
   $ cp libjlinkarm.so /usr/local/lib/

   # Option B: Add SEGGER's J-Link library path to your libraries path.
   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/SEGGER/JLink:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Usage
-----

::

   import pylink

   if __name__ == '__main__':
      serial_no = '123456789'
      jlink = pylink.JLink()

      # Open a connection to your J-Link.
      jlink.open(serial_no)

      # Connect to the target device.
      jlink.connect('device', verbose=True)

      # Do whatever you want from here on in.
      jlink.flash(firmware, 0x0)
      jlink.reset()

Troubleshooting
---------------

Should you run into any issues, refer to the documentation, as well as
check out our `troubleshooting <./TROUBLESHOOTING.md>`__ document.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation follows the `Google Python Style
Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>`__, and uses
`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`__ documentation
generator with the
`Napoleon <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/napoleon.html>`__
extension to provide Google style Python support. To generate the
documentation, these packages will need to be installed (they are
included in the provided ``requirements.txt`` file). With these packages
installed, you can generate the documentation as follows:

::

   $ cd docs
   $ make html

Developing for PyLink
---------------------

First install the development requirements by running:

::

   $ pip install -r requirements.txt

After you’ve installed the requirements, decide on the development work
you want to do. See the documentation about
`contributing <./CONTRIBUTING.md>`__ before you begin your development
work.

Testing
-------

To run tests, execute the following:

::

   # Unit tests
   $ python setup.py test

   # Functional tests
   $ python setup.py bddtest

There are two types of tests: ``functional`` and ``unit``. Information
about both can be found under `tests/README.md <tests/README.md>`__.

Coverage
~~~~~~~~

Code coverage can be generated as follows:

::

   $ python setup.py coverage
   $ open htmlcov/index.html
