class UdpMulticastBus(BusABC):
    """A virtual interface for CAN communications between multiple processes using UDP over Multicast IP.

    It supports IPv4 and IPv6, specified via the channel (which really is just a multicast IP address as a
    string). You can also specify the port and the IPv6 *hop limit*/the IPv4 *time to live* (TTL).

    This bus does not support filtering based on message IDs on the kernel level but instead provides it in
    user space (in Python) as a fallback.

    Both default addresses should allow for multi-host CAN networks in a normal local area network (LAN) where
    multicast is enabled.

    .. note::
        The auto-detection of available interfaces (see) is implemented using heuristic that checks if the
        required socket operations are available. It then returns two configurations, one based on
        the :attr:`~UdpMulticastBus.DEFAULT_GROUP_IPv6` address and another one based on
        the :attr:`~UdpMulticastBus.DEFAULT_GROUP_IPv4` address.

    .. warning::
        The parameter `receive_own_messages` is currently unsupported and setting it to `True` will raise an
        exception.

    .. warning::
        This interface does not make guarantees on reliable delivery and message ordering, and also does not
        implement rate limiting or ID arbitration/prioritization under high loads. Please refer to the section
        :ref:`virtual_interfaces_doc` for more information on this and a comparison to alternatives.

    :param channel: A multicast IPv4 address (in `224.0.0.0/4`) or an IPv6 address (in `ff00::/8`).
                    This defines which version of IP is used. See
                    `Wikipedia ("Multicast address") <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address>`__
                    for more details on the addressing schemes.
                    Defaults to :attr:`~UdpMulticastBus.DEFAULT_GROUP_IPv6`.
    :param port: The IP port to read from and write to.
    :param hop_limit: The hop limit in IPv6 or in IPv4 the time to live (TTL).
    :param receive_own_messages: If transmitted messages should also be received by this bus.
                                 CURRENTLY UNSUPPORTED.
    :param fd:
        If CAN-FD frames should be supported. If set to false, an error will be raised upon sending such a
        frame and such received frames will be ignored.
    :param can_filters: See :meth:`~can.BusABC.set_filters`.

    :raises RuntimeError: If the *msgpack*-dependency is not available. It should be installed on all
                          non Windows platforms via the `setup.py` requirements.
    :raises NotImplementedError: If the `receive_own_messages` is passed as `True`.
