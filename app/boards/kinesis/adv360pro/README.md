# Kinesis Advantage 360 Professional

This board definition provides upstream support for the [Kinesis Advantage 360 Professional](https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/)

Kinesis offer a specific [custom configuration](https://github.com/KinesisCorporation/Adv360-Pro-ZMK/) for the 360 Pro that references [a customised version of ZMK](https://github.com/ReFil/zmk/tree/adv360-z3.2-2) with Advantage 360 Pro specific functionality and changes over base ZMK. The Kinesis fork is regularly updated to bring the latest updates and changes from base ZMK however will not always be completely up to date, some features such as new keycodes will not be immediately available on the 360 Pro after they are implemented in base ZMK.

When using this board definition some of the more advanced features (the indicator RGB leds) will not work, and Kinesis cannot provide customer service for usage of base ZMK. Likewise the ZMK community cannot provide support for either the Kinesis keymap editor, nor any usage of the Kinesis custom fork.
