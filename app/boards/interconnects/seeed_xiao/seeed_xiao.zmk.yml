  The Seeed Studio XIAO is a popular smaller format micro-controller, that has gained popularity as an alternative
  to the SparkFun Pro Micro. Since its creation, several pin compatible controllers, such
  as the Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 (also known as XIAO BLE), Adafruit QT Py and Adafruit QT Py RP2040, have become available.

  ZMK uses the "D"-prefixed, green color coded pin names, e.g. `D2`, to generate devicetree node references. For example, to refer to the pin labeled `D0` in the diagram, use `&xiao_d 0` in the devicetree files.
