# Building ZMK for the Nibble

Some general notes/commands for building standard nibble layouts from the assembly documentation.

## LED Notes

```
CONFIG_ZMK_RGB_UNDERGLOW=n
```

## Encoder Notes

If you built your nibble without an encoder, you'll need to change the following in your local nibble config or add them to the end of the file.

```
CONFIG_EC11=n
CONFIG_EC11_TRIGGER_GLOBAL_THREAD=n
```

## OLED Builds
