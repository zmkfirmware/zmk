## MoErgo Glove80

This board definition provides ZMK support for the [MoErgo Glove80](https://www.moergo.com)
keyboard.

MoErgo additionally offers a customized version of ZMK which adds additional functionality such as
RGB status indicators, available on GitHub at [moergo-sc/zmk](https://github.com/moergo-sc/zmk). The
MoErgo customized ZMK fork is regularly updated to include the latest changes from mainline ZMK, but
will not always be completely up-to-date. MoErgo also offers an online layout configurator and
firmware builder application using the customized fork at [my.glove80.com](https://my.glove80.com).

While mainline ZMK is expected to work well with Glove80, MoErgo only provides support for use of
their customized fork. Likewise, the ZMK community cannot directly provide support for MoErgo's fork.
