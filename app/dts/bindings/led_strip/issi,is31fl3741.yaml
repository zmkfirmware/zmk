      Gamma correction lookup values.
      The gamma values make the LED brightness seem more linear to human eyes.
      Default values match the recommendation from the IC datasheet but note this may
      or may not work for your particular LEDs.

  red-scaling:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 255
    description: |
      Red channel scaling factor on a scale of 0-255.
      This setting adjusts the brightness of red pixels relative to other channels by scaling the amount
      of current flowing through them. 255 being equivalent to the value of led-max-current.

  green-scaling:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 255
    description: |
      Green channel scaling factor on a scale of 0-255.
      This setting adjusts the brightness of green pixels relative to other channels by scaling the amount
      of current flowing through them. 255 being equivalent to the value of led-max-current.

  blue-scaling:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 255
    description: |
      Blue channel scaling factor on a scale of 0-255.
      This setting adjusts the brightness of blue pixels relative to other channels by scaling the amount
      of current flowing through them. 255 being equivalent to the value of led-max-current.
