# Hold Single Double Tests

These tests validate the behavior_hold_single_double behavior:

- **1-tap**: Single tap within tapping-term-ms triggers the single-tap behavior
- **2-double-tap**: Two quick taps within tapping-term-ms trigger the double-tap behavior
- **3-hold**: Holding key longer than tapping-term-ms triggers the hold behavior
