The following pages detail adding lighting support to ZMK keyboards, which currently supports two lighting systems: underglow and backlight.

Although the naming of the systems might imply it, which system you use typically does _not_ depend on the physical location of the LEDs.
Instead, you should use the one that supports the LED hardware type that your keyboard has.
