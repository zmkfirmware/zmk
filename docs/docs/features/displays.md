Displays in ZMK are currently a proof of concept and official support is coming soon.

:::info
Although ZMK-powered keyboards _are_ capable of utilizing OLED and ePaper displays, the Displays feature is not yet considered production-ready due to an issue where the display remains blank after resuming from [external power cutoff](../behaviors/power.md#external-power-control). This issue can be tracked on GitHub at [zmkfirmware/zmk #674](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/674).
