ZMK Firmware is an open source (MIT) keyboard firmware built on the [Zephyr‚Ñ¢ Project](https://zephyrproject.org/) Real Time Operating System (RTOS).
ZMK's goal is to provide a modern and powerful firmware that is designed for power-efficiency, flexibility, and broad hardware support.
ZMK is capable of being used for both wired and wireless input devices.
