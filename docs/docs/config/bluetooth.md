## Kconfig

| Option                                 | Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Default |
| -------------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `CONFIG_ZMK_BLE_EXPERIMENTAL_CONN`     | bool | Enables a combination of settings that are planned to be default in future versions of ZMK to improve connection stability. Currently this only disables 2M PHY support.                                           | n       |
| `CONFIG_ZMK_BLE_EXPERIMENTAL_SEC`      | bool | Enables a combination of settings that are planned to be officially supported in the future. This includes enabling BT Secure Connection passkey entry, and allows overwrite of keys from previously paired hosts. | n       |
| `CONFIG_ZMK_BLE_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES` | bool | Aggregate config that enables both `CONFIG_ZMK_BLE_EXPERIMENTAL_CONN` and `CONFIG_ZMK_BLE_EXPERIMENTAL_SEC`.                                                                                                       | n       |
| `CONFIG_ZMK_BLE_PASSKEY_ENTRY`         | bool | Enable passkey entry during pairing for enhanced security. (Note: After enabling this, you will need to re-pair all previously paired hosts.)                                                                      | n       |
| `CONFIG_BT_GATT_ENFORCE_SUBSCRIPTION`  | bool | Low level setting for GATT subscriptions. Set to `n` to work around an annoying Windows bug with battery notifications.                                                                                            | y       |
