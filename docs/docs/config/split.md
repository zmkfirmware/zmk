### Wired Splits

Hardware UARTs have a few different modes/approaches to sending and receiving data, with different levels of complexity and performance. Not all hardware nor drivers support all modes, so ZMK has code to support different interaction modes with the UART as needed. The default mode should be properly selected based on the platform's report support, but you can choose to override the mode if needed.

- Polling Mode - The least efficient mode, this requires the MCU to constantly poll the UART to see if more data has been received, taking time away from other processing. This is basic mode supported by all UART drivers.
- Interrupt Mode - This mode allows the MCU to do other processing until the UART raises an interrupt to signal new data has been received. On platforms where this is combined with a FIFO, there is even less superfluous processing, and high speeds can be achieved while allowing other processing to continue. Examples:
  - RP2040
  - nRF52
- Async (DMA) Mode - Similar to interrupt mode, data reception can occur without involving the MCU. Additionally, larger volumes can be copied directly into accessible memory without the use of the MCU, allowing even further efficiency/rates without tying up the MCU. Only some drivers support this mode (and the current Zephyr 3.5 version of the nRF52 UART has some bugs that prevent its use). Examples:
  - SAM0 (e.g. SAMD21)
  - STM32 (e.g. stm32f072)

Following wired [split keyboard](../features/split-keyboards.md) settings are defined in [zmk/app/src/split/wired/Kconfig](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/blob/main/app/src/split/wired/Kconfig).

## Devicetree

### Wired Split

Wired splits require a properly configured UART to function. If writing a shield, you may be able to use the standard UART already provided by the board, e.g. `&pro_micro_serial`. See [predefined nodes](../development/hardware-integration/pinctrl.mdx#predefined-nodes) for details on the UART node labels provided by various interconnects. If you are creating your own board, or using custom pins for the UART, see the documentation on [pin control](../development/hardware-integration/pinctrl.mdx#additional-examples) to configure the pins for your UART.

Once you have a properly configured UART device, it needs to be assigned in a new node with a compatible value of `"zmk,wired-split"`. For example:

```dts
/ {
    wired_split {
        compatible = "zmk,wired-split";
        device = <&pro_micro_serial>;
    };
};
```
