:::warning

ZMK Firmware is still an early stage project. Many features are still waiting to be implemented, and only a select few keyboards
have had their hardware details codified in boards/shields for ZMK.

:::

With the solid technical foundation of Zephyr™ RTOS, ZMK can support a wide diversity of hardware targets.
That being said, there are currently only a few specific [boards](/docs/faq#what-is-a-board)/[shields](/docs/faq#what-is-a-shield) that have been written and tested by the ZMK contributors.

## Other Hardware

In addition to the basic keyboard functionality, there is some initial support for additional keyboard hardware:

- Encoders
- OLEDs
- RGB Underglow

Until detailed documentation is available, feel free to ask questions about how these are supported in the [Discord server](https://zmkfirmware.dev/community/discord/invite).

## Contributing

If you'd like to add support for a new keyboard shield, head over to the [New Keyboard Shield](development/new-shield) documentation.
