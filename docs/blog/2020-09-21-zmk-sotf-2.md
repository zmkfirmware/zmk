## Hacktoberfest Preparation

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a yearly celebration of open source,
which encourages participation in OSS, especially from new contributors.

The ZMK contributors have been busy preparing for folks to join in on the fun by contributing to
ZMK!

- There is now a basic [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to help newcomers get oriented, and get up to speed.
- The [`Hacktoberfest`](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHacktoberfest)
  issue label will help participants discover good issues to work on.
  (The existing [`good first issue`](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label also helps with this)

We're looking forward to the launch of Hacktoberfest!

## Mascot Selection Feedback

the process before a final mascot is selected.
